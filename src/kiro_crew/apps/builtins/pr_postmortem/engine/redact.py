"""Credential redactor for this app's model-authored data.

Everything this app serves is derived from two untrusted sources: pull-request
prose written by anyone who can open a PR, and an analyst model's free text about
it. Both are persisted verbatim under the app's data directory and both reach a
browser surface -- so an AKIA key or a `ghp_…` token pasted into a PR body would
otherwise be rendered to the dashboard unscrubbed.

SCOPE, measured rather than assumed (see tests/test_review_regressions.py):
``redact_credentials`` removes credential SHAPES. ``redact_exfiltration_urls`` is
applied as well for parity with the other app sinks, but it does NOT filter
ordinary third-party links -- a `https://webhook.site/...` URL, and even
`https://user:pass@host`, pass through. This is a credential scrub, not a link
sanitiser, and the difference matters when reading a report.

Mirrors ``apps/builtins/mochi/redact.py``, which exists for exactly this shape of
problem. Kept as a leaf module (depending only on ``kiro_crew.security``) so any
consumer can import it at module scope without a circular import.

Every path that carries model-authored or PR-authored text onward -- a written
bundle, a prompt built from one -- passes it through here first.
