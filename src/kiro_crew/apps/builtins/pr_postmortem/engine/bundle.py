The bundle is everything a postmortem needs and nothing it has to go fetch:
both sides of the diff, what review said about the culprit at the time, whether
CI was even green on it, and which tests the fix had to add. Collection is
deterministic -- no model involved -- so the analysis step is pure judgement over
a fixed record.

open a PR. Every such field is carried under a ``untrusted`` key and must be
