# ── Git publish detection (verb-anchored) ──
# ``git push`` must be blocked, but ``push`` appearing anywhere in arbitrary
# command text (a commit message, a branch name, a grep pattern, an ssh remote
# payload) must NOT trip the deny.  We therefore require ``push`` to be the git
# *subcommand* — i.e. the first non-flag/non-option token after ``git`` — rather
# than a substring.  Mirrors the anchored regex in
# ``config/defaults.json`` deniedCommands.
#
# ``git [<-c k=v>...] [<-C path>...] push ...`` is a publish.  Intervening
# tokens may only be options (``-x``) or option-with-value pairs
# (``-C /path``, ``-c core.x=y``) — a bare non-flag token before ``push``
# (e.g. ``stash``) means ``push`` is NOT the subcommand, so ``git stash push``
# is correctly allowed.  Anchored to a segment start (optionally preceded by a
# command separator) so ``git log --grep push`` is not matched.
#
# The trailing terminator is a lookahead that accepts whitespace, end-of-string,
# OR a shell metacharacter that closes/terminates the segment — so a bare
# ``git push`` (no remote/branch, valid: pushes current branch to the default
# remote) is still caught inside ``$(git push)``, `` `git push` ``, ``git push|cat``,
# ``git push&``, etc., not just when followed by a space.

    # ``[^-\s]`` (not ``[^-]``): the optional non-flag arg after a flag must
