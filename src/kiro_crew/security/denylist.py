def is_denied(tool_name: str, extra_patterns: list[str] | None = None) -> str | None:
    """Check tool name against built-in + extra deny patterns.

    Returns denial reason string, or None if allowed.

    ── Two-pass evaluation ──
    Pass 1 (whole-string): every deny pattern is matched against the
    full input.  If a pattern matches and **no exception pattern also
    matches the full input**, the input is denied immediately.  This
    closes evasion vectors where the deny string spans a separator
    boundary that per-segment splitting would erase, e.g.
    ``git$(echo ' ')push origin main`` (which bash evaluates to
    ``git push origin main``): the whole string contains both ``git`` and
    ``push`` so the broad ``*git*push*`` glob matches, and there is no
    matching exception, so the command is denied at this stage even
    though splitting on ``$(`` / ``)`` would otherwise produce no
    segment containing both substrings.

    Pass 2 (per-segment) only runs if pass 1 found a deny match **and**
    the full input also matched at least one exception for that pattern.
    The input is split on shell command separators (``;``, ``&&``,
    ``||``, ``|``, newlines) and command-substitution boundaries
    (``$(``, ``)``, backticks) into segments, and each segment is
    re-evaluated independently.  This preserves the chaining-bypass
    protection (any embedded real
    publish lives in its own segment and matches the deny pattern in its
    own right) while allowing the legitimate stash-in-pipeline case
    that the prior whole-string design over-blocked.

    Edge cases & limitations:
      - Pass-1 deny is conservative: anything matching a deny glob with
        no exception is blocked, even if the input is structurally
        contorted.
      - Pass-2 splitting is purely textual; quoted strings and escaped
        separators are split anyway (over-blocking is the safer
        direction).
      - Heredoc bodies, ``eval``, ``bash -c``, etc., are not parsed
        specially.  If those become evasion vectors in practice, add
        explicit deny patterns for them.

    Audit:
      - Every denial path emits a ``deny_event`` SEL event via
        ``_emit_deny_event``.
      - Every granted exception emits a ``deny_exception`` SEL event via
        ``_emit_deny_exception_event`` (fail-closed: if SEL logging
        fails the exception is not granted).

    Args:
        tool_name: The full command line / tool invocation to evaluate.
        extra_patterns: Optional fnmatch glob patterns to append to the
            built-in deny list (typically from user config).

    Returns:
        Denial reason string (mentioning the matched pattern), or
        ``None`` if the input is allowed.
