# ── Resource Limits (preexec_fn) ──
# Applied to agent-influenced subprocess spawns to bound resource-exhaustion
# attacks (fork bombs, FD exhaustion, runaway memory/CPU) so a compromised or
# buggy tool/MCP server cannot starve the host out from under the gateway.
# Uses POSIX resource limits (setrlimit); see docs/resource-protection.md.

# Default ceilings. Only RLIMIT_NOFILE is default-on: it is per-PROCESS,
# generous enough that no legitimate tool trips it, yet finite so a descriptor
# leak (which climbs unbounded) is arrested. The other three default to 0
# (disabled) ON PURPOSE — each is unsafe as a blanket default (see the caveats
# below) — but all four stay operator-configurable per deployment.
#
# Why not a default-on fork-bomb / memory cap? RLIMIT is the wrong tool for
# those defaults: RLIMIT_NPROC is per-UID (not per-subtree) and RLIMIT_AS caps
# virtual (not resident) memory. cgroup v2 ``pids.max`` / ``memory.max`` are the
# correct per-cgroup fork-bomb and RSS ceilings and are tracked as future work
# (see docs/resource-protection.md); the ticket itself lists cgroup v2 as the
# alternative. This helper delivers the safe RLIMIT subset now and leaves the
# hazardous knobs opt-in.

    # A busy login/desktop UID can already hold thousands of threads (a fork
    # bomb is bounded only relative to that shared total), so any fixed cap that

    # runs as its own dedicated UID; operators opt in via config there.

    # globally for Node-backed spawns. The default-on memory ceiling is instead
    # the cgroup v2 scope (sandbox.cgroup_scope_argv → memory.max, an RSS cap,
    # host-proportional by default — 65% of physical RAM, so ~10.6 GB on a
    # 16 GB box / ~21.3 GB on 32 GB), which this same ``max_memory_mb`` key

    Reads limits from the ``resource_limits`` config section:
      - ``max_processes``: RLIMIT_NPROC (process count for the child's UID).
      - ``max_open_files``: RLIMIT_NOFILE (open file descriptors).
      - ``max_cpu_seconds``: RLIMIT_CPU in seconds (``0`` disables — default).
      - ``max_memory_mb``: RLIMIT_AS (virtual address space) in MB (``0``
        disables — default; see the RLIMIT_AS caveat in ``_RLIMIT_DEFAULTS``).

    Each key accepts a positive integer to set that limit, or ``0`` to leave the
    limit unchanged (inherited). Missing keys fall back to ``_RLIMIT_DEFAULTS``.
    A requested limit is always clamped DOWN to the inherited hard limit — we
    never try to *raise* a ceiling (an unprivileged child cannot, and the
    attempt would raise), so this can only tighten, never loosen, the child's
    budget.

    The returned callable is intended for use as ``preexec_fn`` in
    ``subprocess.Popen`` / ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec``. It runs in the
    child process after fork but before exec — setrlimit calls here only affect
    the child. It is a no-op on non-POSIX platforms (``resource`` unavailable)
    and degrades gracefully per-limit on platforms lacking a specific rlimit
    (e.g. macOS has no RLIMIT_NPROC / a flaky RLIMIT_AS).

    NOTE: ``preexec_fn`` runs post-fork in a subprocess that may be
    multi-threaded; it MUST stay async-signal-safe — only ``getrlimit`` /
    ``setrlimit`` here, no allocation-heavy or lock-taking work.

    Args:
        config: Full KiroCrew config dict (or any subset containing
            ``resource_limits``). Pass None for defaults.
